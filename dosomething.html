          <div class="template">
            As a Western student, I find it unacceptable that Western has increased international tuition during a global pandemic, especially when this change in tuition has come without explanation and justification.
            <br>
            <br>
            The university must respond to the 2600+ people that have signed this change.org petition: <u>https://www.change.org/p/president-of-western-university-help-stop-tuition-fee-hikes </u>
            <br>
            <br>
            The university must respond to the fact that it has publicly claimed that tuition increases were necessary because of "increased inflationary costs", while it cuts faculty budgets and continues to make larger in revenue than it ever has before: <u>tiny.cc/uworeceipts</u>
            <br>
            <br>
            It is your responsibility to do everything in your power to improve the financial transparency of the school. It is unacceptable that the university is making more money than ever before - at the cost of international students - while the overall quality of education on campus deteriorates. Please do everything in your power to advocate for international students, who are being offered meagre loans and bursaries instead of the respect and dignity they deserve. By bullying its international students, Western only furthers the narrative that it is a ‚Äúwhite partying school,‚Äù and enforces the idea that those who bring diversity on campus are not welcomed. International students are worth more than their tuition money - they are a valuable force for diversity on our campus -  and should be treated accordingly.
